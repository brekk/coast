Beliefs about work:

1. Work should be *interesting*. *Interesting* work has one or more essential qualities:

  * 🤔 It is *Hard*. This includes things that are of a specialized space or industry, or things which are trying to solve a problem that is tricky to quantify or qualify. Interesting work which is hard helps nail down this space or industry. Quantity of work doesn't necessarily qualify something as *Hard*; simply having lots of work to do doesn't make it *Hard*, it makes it onerous.
  * 🔬 It is *Complex*. This includes things which are arbitrarily complicated or hard to frame simply (or appear to be at face-value). This doesn't include things which are vague in definition. 

2. Work should be *valuable*. *Valuable* work has one or more essential qualities:
  * 💰 It solves a business problem.
  * 💣 It doesn't solve a business problem for:
    - Military
    - Advertising
    - Industries working against social welfare
  * 👩‍🏫 It teaches someone something non-trivial in nature.
  * 🛠 It provides a tool which has utility in multiple purposes.
  * ↔️  It provides a tool which automates. Automation is what allows for rules. Rules are conventions made concrete. Conventions are ephemeral constructs which have intention behind them but often lack the structure to be enforced.

3. Work should be *fun*. *Fun* work has one or more essential qualities:

  * It makes someone laugh out loud.
  * It makes someone engage and spend time engaging in something they would otherwise ignore.
  * It makes someone think creatively.
